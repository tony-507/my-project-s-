# my project(s)

This repository contains projects that I do when I am self-studying data analytics from Coursera and web applications from some textbooks. Most projects are still under development. Refer to the sections below for more information.

## Alien Invasion

This is a simple game project from the book **Python Crash Course** by **Eric Matthes**. The project uses Pygame as framework to reconstruct the classic arcade game "Space Invaders". The project employs basic functionalities of Pygame such as time, sprite and group. I have attempted to add some features not taught in the book:
  - alien can also shoot bullets
  - the ship gets a shield every 2 level, with a corresponding shield image
  - the highest score can be kept even after quitting game by writing it to an external text file

## Data

This is a small data analytics project from the book **Python Crash Course** by **Eric Matthes**. The project uses Python to analyze data from web and present those data in different forms, e.g. bar chart, scatter plot and world map. It employs the following libraries:
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - request

## Learning Log

This is a project from the book **Python Crash Course** by **Eric Matthes**. The project aims to demonstrate the usage of Django framework. It provides the following functionalities:
  - Creation of users
  - User-owned topics and entries
  - Data protection from unauthorized access
  
The project is deployed using Heroku, with the link https://proj-django-learning-log.herokuapp.com.
  
## Discrete mathematics

This is a file containing codes to some mathematical problems like magic squares.
