# Stat

This folder contains some statistical simulation I have done during self-studying statistics.

## conf_sim

This script contains simulation of confidence intervals of samples from normal distributions. The program outputs two figures.
- Left: Intervals formed with known variance
- Right: Intervals formed with sample variance

## cauchy_resample

This program applies resampling technique to determine the distribution of trimmed mean of a Cauchy distribution as an estimator of median. The program outputs two figures.
- Left: Histogram of values of trimmed means
- Right: q-q plot of trimmed means with N(0,1)
