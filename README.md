# my project(s)

This repository contains projects that I do when I am self-studying data analytics from Coursera and web applications from some textbooks. Most projects are still under development. Refer to the sections below for more information.

## Data

This is a small data analytics project from the book **Python Crash Course** by **Eric Matthes**. The project uses Python to analyze data from web and present those data in different forms, e.g. bar chart, scatter plot and world map. It employs the following libraries:
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - request

## Learning Log

This is a project from the book **Python Crash Course** by **Eric Matthes**. The project uses Django as the framework. It employs basic client-server technology to allow interactions between users:
  - Existence of admin (superuser)
  - Create, edit and delete entries
  
Throughout this project, the following techniques are utilized:
  - Form handling
  - Decomposition into modules
  - Inheritance of modules
  - Use of Boostrap templates
