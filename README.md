# my project(s)

This repository contains projects that I do when I am self-studying data analytics from Coursera and web applications from some textbooks. Most projects are still under development. Refer to the sections below for more information.

## Data

This is a small data analytics project from the book **Python Crash Course** by **Eric Matthes**. The project uses Python to analyze data from web and present those data in different forms, e.g. bar chart, scatter plot and world map. It employs the following libraries:
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - request

## Learning Log

This is a project from the book **Python Crash Course** by **Eric Matthes**. The project aims to demonstrate the usage of Django framework. It provides the following functionalities:
  - Creation of users
  - User-owned topics and entries
  - Data protection from unauthorized access
  
The project is deployed using Heroku, with the link https://shrouded-reaches-12756.herokuapp.com.
  
## ML_MATLAB

This is a machine learning project on MATLAB based on courses offered by Stanford University on Coursera. The project employs MATLAB for learning and teaches the following algorithms:
  - Regressions for inference and classification
  - Neural network for nonlinear model (forward and backward propagation)
  - Clustering
